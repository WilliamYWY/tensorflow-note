# TensorFlow Learning Note

## Intro

Compared with Keras (antother awsome machine learning package under TensorFlow), TensorFlow provide more flexibility for building neural networks. Which also means that there are a lot of parameters needed to be written and function to be understand (~~still very convenient to use after endless learning?~~). Hopes these notes can help those who want to take a glance of how it works ^^.
